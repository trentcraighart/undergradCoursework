moist  1 there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again  0 hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt

this place easily  0 once your food arrives its meh  0 paying  for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal  0 my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too  0 so good i am going to have to review this place twice  once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night  1 the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh  1 mediocre food  0 once you get inside youll be impressed with the place  1 and service was super friendly  1 why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked  0 this place was such a nice surprise  1 they were goldencrispy and delicious  1 i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are

experience  1 the food came out at a good pace  1 i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad  1 we could not believe how dirty the oysters were  0 i would not recommend this place  0 to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted  0 bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise  0 the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit  1 so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat  1 went in for happy hour great list of wines  1 some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot  1 this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant  1 talk about great customer service of course we will be back  1 i love their fries and their beans  1 they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval  1 for sushi on the strip this is the place to go  1 the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best  0 i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one  0 weird vibe from owners  0 there was hardly any meat  0 ive had better bagels from the grocery store  0 i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude  1 now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless  0 the service was terrible food was mediocre  0 i ordered albondigas soup  which was just warm  and tasted

extremely slow  0 after 0 minutes wait i got a table  0 no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts  0 my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love  1 i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service  1 the pizza selections are good  1 i had strawberry tea which was good  1 spend your money elsewhere  0 their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm  1 the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated  0 and the drinks are weak people  0 my order was not correct  0 very very sad  0 im not impressed with the concept or the food  0 i got food poisoning here at the buffet  0 they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no  0 what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us  0 needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon  0 the ri style calamari was a joke  0 it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it  0 we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one  0 the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all  0 waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying  0 this place lacked style  0 the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 1 ridiculous  0 dont bother coming here  0 the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again  0 probably not in a hurry to go back  0 not good by any stretch of the imagination  0 the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked  0 it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor  0 this place is horrible and way overpriced  0 it wasnt busy at all and now we know why  0 the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits  0 con spotty service  0 the fries were not hot and neither was my burger  0 the real disappointment was our waiter  0 my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything  0 she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door  0 del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible  0 weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant  0 the ambiance isnt much better  0 unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees  0 the food wasnt good  0 too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place  0 i kept looking at the time and it had soon become  minutes yet still no food  0 we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh  0 food was below average  0 it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant  0 the problem i have is that they charge 11 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables  0 it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry  0 the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland  0 a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad  0
