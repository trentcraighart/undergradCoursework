* Date Created: 7/25/2019
* Filename: circularList.c
*
* Overview:
*   This program is a circular doubly linked list implementation
*	of a deque with a front sentinel.
*	It allows for the following behavior:
*		- adding a new link to the front/back
*		- getting the value of the front/back links
*		- removing the front/back link
*		- checking if the deque is empty
*		- printing the values of all the links
*		- reversing the order of the links
*
*	Note that this implementation uses double links (links with
*	next and prev pointers) and that given that it is a circular
*	linked deque the last link points to the sentinel and the first
*	link points to the Sentinel -- instead of null.
